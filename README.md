# Heart-disease
Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains a project focused on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various data analysis, preprocessing, and classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical attributes.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify individuals at risk of heart disease. The dataset used in this project includes various medical parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and understanding the dataset.
Feature Selection: Identifying important features that contribute to heart disease prediction.
Model Building: Implementing and evaluating different machine learning algorithms.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the predictive models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
